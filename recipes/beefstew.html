                    <li>1 tbsp chopped flatleaf parsley</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Method:</h3>
        <style>ol li{
            padding: 5px 0px;
            }</style>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.</li>

                <li>For the beef stew, heat the oil and butter in an ovenproof casserole and fry the beef until browned on all sides.</li>

                <li>Sprinkle over the flour and cook for a further 2-3 minutes. Add the garlic and all the vegetables and fry for 1-2 minutes.</li>

                <li>Stir in the wine, stock and herbs, then add the Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar, to taste. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>

                <li>Cover with a lid, transfer to the oven and cook for about two hours, or until the meat is tender.</li>

                <li>For the dumplings, sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Add the suet and enough water to form a thick dough.</li>

                <li>With floured hands, roll spoonfuls of the dough into small balls.</li>

                <li>After two hours, remove the lid from the stew and place the balls on top of the stew. Cover, return to the oven and cook for a further 20 minutes, or until the dumplings have puffed up and are tender. (If you prefer your dumplings with a golden top, leave the lid off when returning to the oven.)</li>
                
                <li>To serve, place a spoonful of mashed potato onto each of four serving plates and top with the stew and dumplings. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.</li>
