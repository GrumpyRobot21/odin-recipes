                <li>½ tsp sugar</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>200ml/7fl oz passata</li>
                <li>500ml/17fl oz vegetable stock</li>
                <li>100ml/3½fl oz single cream or low-fat crème fraîche</li>
                <li>splash dry sherry</li>

            </ul>

        <h3>Method:</h3>
        <style>ol li{
            padding: 5px 0px;
            }</style>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and cook the onion for 5-6 minutes over a gentle heat until almost softened but not browned. Add the garlic, celery, carrots, bay leaf and thyme and cook for a further 6-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, making sure the vegetables don't stick to the base of the pan.</li>

                <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and sugar and season well with salt and pepper. Cook for a few minutes, then stir in the passata and vegetable stock. Bring to a simmer, cover with a lid and cook for 35-40 minutes, until all the vegetables are tender.</li>

                <li>Remove the bay leaf and thyme, then blend the soup in a liquidizer or food processor. This will probably have to be done in two batches. Pour the soup into a clean saucepan, passing it through a sieve if you want it really smooth. Stir in the cream, a splash of sherry and extra seasoning if required.</li>

                <li>Pour into large mugs or bowls and serve with fresh crusty buttered bread.</li>
               
            </ol>
